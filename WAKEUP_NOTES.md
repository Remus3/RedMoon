# Wakeup Notes

Last two or three sessions at full fidelity. Archive older entries to
`docs/history_notes.md`.

## 2026-07-26 - Cycle 2 part 1: ADR-005, the Python half, spikes S4 and S3a closed

Branch `cycle-2-bridge`, two commits (`9fbce0c`, `251803b`). Cycle 2 is NOT
done and is not claimed to be. Ledger entry 002a carries the detail.

The two things the last session said must be settled BEFORE code are settled:

1. Port arbitration. RULED: mint the fifth port. Client binds 8777, dedicated
   server binds 8780, chosen by `core.ports.bridge_port_for_host`. ADR-005
   amends ADR-003. The stand-down path, install step 6b, acceptance criterion 5b
   and risk R15 are STRUCK from the spec - do not implement them. Operator
   approved the frozen `core/ports.py` edit and the ADR amendment before it was
   made.
2. `PrefabCollectionSystem`. CONFIRMED, not corrected:
   `ProjectM.PrefabCollectionSystem` in `ProjectM.Shared.dll`, deriving from
   `Stunlock.Core.PrefabCollectionSystem_Base`. The label carried from
   `ROADMAP.md` survives contact with the build.

State at close, every number observed in one run after the last edit:
`python -m pytest` 241 passed (was 106), `python -m ruff check .` clean,
`python tools/ascii_guard.py` exit 0.

Shipped: `gen_bridge_ports.py`, `core/bridge_client.py`, `core/table_deep.py`,
`install_bepinex.py`, `rmdata_ingest.py`, `bridge_probe.py`,
`Directory.Build.props`, ADR-005, `docs/BRIDGE_SPIKES.md`.

Environment, done and verified live: BepInEx 1.733.2 installed into BOTH hosts
(233 files each, Thunderstore metadata dropped, `v3\` untouched). The dedicated
server launched once and generated 169 Il2CppInterop assemblies. Both v3
negative controls refuse.

Spike status. S4 CLOSED by measurement: a net6.0 library builds under SDK
10.0.301 with NO targeting pack and NO `global.json` - neither fallback is
needed. S3a CLOSED. S3 PARTIAL - the component types are located and named
(`EquippableData`, `RecipeData`, `RecipeRequirementBuffer`, `SpellLevel`,
`BloodQualityBuff`), the field mapping is not done. S1, S2, S5, S6 OPEN.

One process incident, and the plugin contract that fell out of it. `251803b` was
committed while a build agent was still live and captured its file mid-mutation
test, so that ONE commit carries a disabled v3 guard in `bridge_probe.py`.
Correct at `d614a09` and at HEAD; verified with `git show`, not taken on the
agent's word; no history rewrite. Standing rule, re-paid: do not commit while
agents live, and read `git show --stat` afterwards.

That agent's mutation testing also found a hole worth knowing about: a mutation
letting the loader-log banner matcher accept ANY line containing
`RedMoon.Bridge` SURVIVED 25 tests, because the negative fixture had no banner
token at all. That is cycle 1's failure mode a second time - a gate that cannot
fail. It is now pinned. CONSEQUENCE: `Plugin.cs` must emit a banner carrying
version, host AND port, shaped `RedMoon.Bridge v<semver> host=<client|server>
port=<n>`. The probe requires all three tokens.

Three things the next session must not get wrong:

1. The CLIENT has BepInEx but has NOT been launched, so it has no `interop\`
   tree yet. The R17 interop diff cannot run and no `.csproj` reference set may
   be pinned until it does. Launching the game client was left to the operator
   deliberately rather than done unattended.
2. S1 parts b, c and d are NOT answerable from static metadata. `LogOutput.log`
   carries loader activity only and never names a world - that was checked, not
   assumed. Enumerating worlds needs a plugin in-process, so the correct next
   artifact is a MINIMAL enumerate-and-log plugin, not the full bridge.
3. Honest correction to acceptance criterion 2: the `--target server` pointed at
   the root negative control is UNREACHABLE, not refused, because the installer
   derives the server target from `--root`. Prevented by construction, but not
   the control the spec asked for. Do not tick it off as passed.

## 2026-07-26 - Cycle 2 spec APPROVED, no code yet

Spec written and approved: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-redmoon-bridge-design.md`.
ADR-004 records the ruling. No C# exists yet. Suite still 106 passed,
`ascii_guard` exit 0, both observed this session rather than carried forward.

Ground truth probed live, all of it new:

- The install holds TWO full game copies. Root is `v1.1.13.0-r99712-b17`, the
  pinned build and the one Steam launches. `v3\` is a stale `v1.0.10.4-r91333`
  copy that must never receive BepInEx. The installer asserts VERSION first.
- IL2CPP, not Mono (`GameAssembly.dll`). Loader is BepInExPack V Rising
  `1.733.2`, wrapping BepInEx 6.0.0 bleeding-edge `be.733` on CoreCLR net6.
- `VRising_Server\VERSION` reads `VRisingServer: v1.1.13.0-r99712-b17
  (202605251709)`. Same semantic build as the client, DIFFERENT prefix and
  trailing timestamp, so the install assert compares the semantic build only.
- The game was launched once. `AppData\LocalLow\Stunlock Studios\VRising\` now
  exists with `Player.log`, `Settings\v4\ClientSettings.json`, `CloudSaves\` and
  `ConsoleProfile\`. No save directory, because no world was created.
- Only SDK present is .NET 10.0.301. The plugin targets net6.0. That path is an
  unresolved build risk, not a working config.

Operator rulings: the plugin targets BOTH hosts (client and dedicated server,
ADR-004, overriding the client-only recommendation); `/state` becomes an
envelope carrying `state: null` plus a build stamp and `docs/API.md` was amended
to match; generating `RmPorts.g.cs` into the `test_ports.py` allowlist is
approved; the C# test project is deferred past cycle 2; and downloading the
BepInEx pack is authorized for the next session only.

Two things the next session must settle BEFORE writing code:

1. Port 8777 arbitration when both hosts run at once has a chosen answer, not a
   clean one - bind-time first-come, loser stands down, plus a procedural
   "start the server first". That is procedure, not enforcement. Minting a fifth
   port instead needs an ADR-003 amendment and that call belongs before
   implementation.
2. `PrefabCollectionSystem` is an UNVERIFIED label carried from `ROADMAP.md`. It
   is not a confirmed type name. Six spikes (S1 to S6) remain open and block
   implementation.

## 2026-07-26 - Cycle 1 COMPLETE and merged

Cycle 1 shipped end to end. Branch `cycle-1-harness`, 34 commits, merged into
`master` as `2a493ea`. Ledger entry 001 carries the detail.

State at close, all verified live rather than reported:

- `python -m pytest` 106 passed, `python -m ruff check .` clean,
  `python tools/ascii_guard.py` exits 0.
- `python tools/rmdata_extract.py` writes `data/rmdata/1.1.13.0-r99712/` with
  8379 localization strings and 28 markup codes, byte-identical across runs, and
  seeds `tables/` with five empty validated envelopes for the cycle 2 bridge.
- Remote is `https://github.com/Remus3/RedMoon` (private). `master` pushed.
- `RM-DataRefresh` is installed and Ready, next run 05:30 daily.
- Memory namespace live at
  `C:\Users\Administrator\.claude\projects\C--RedMoon\memory\`, restorable from
  the committed seed in `docs/memory_seed/`.

Two findings worth carrying forward, both caught by review rather than by
running code:

1. The precommit gate was wired with `"matcher": "Bash(git commit:*)"` -
   permission-rule syntax in a field matched against the tool name - so it never
   fired for the whole cycle despite being unit-tested and documented. Fixed to
   `Bash|PowerShell`, with a test that now rejects specifier syntax in any
   matcher. Worth remembering: a hook passing its unit tests says nothing about
   whether it is wired.
2. `docs/BLOODFORGE.md` named `data/rmdata/<build>/tables/*.json` as Bloodforge's
   inputs, but nothing created that directory and `empty_table()` had no
   production caller. Cycle 2 would have invented the path by accident. The
   extractor now produces the seam, never clobbering a populated table.

Parked items and every review ruling are archived in `docs/history_notes.md`.

## 2026-07-26 - Cycle 1 kickoff

Project created at `C:\RedMoon\`. Design spec and implementation plan written
and committed. Ground truth probed: V Rising build
`v1.1.13.0-r99712-b17 (202605251526)`, install at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VRising`, game never launched (no
`AppData\LocalLow\Stunlock Studios`), dedicated server ships with the client.
Ports 8777, 8778, 8779 and 8783 confirmed free; the `RM-*` scheduled-task
namespace confirmed unused.

Key decision: item and ability stat data cannot be extracted offline. It arrives
in cycle 2 from the runtime bridge dump. Cycle 1 ships localization, difficulty
presets, settings schema, and empty typed tables.
