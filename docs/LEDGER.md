## 001 - Cycle 1: harness plus data floor (2026-07-26)

Shipped the Red Moon process harness and the offline data floor. ASCII guard,
port registry, doctrine documents, living docs, ADR-001 through ADR-003, the
data extractor, typed table schemas, four enforcement hooks, the verifier
subagent, three slash commands, the memory namespace seed, and RM-DataRefresh
registration.

Verified: `python -m pytest` reports 92 passed; `python tools/ascii_guard.py`
exits 0; `python tools/rmdata_extract.py` is idempotent and writes
`data/rmdata/1.1.13.0-r99712/`; the commit gate blocks a staged em-dash.
